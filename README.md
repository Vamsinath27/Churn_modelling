Churn Modelling Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). By analyzing customer data, we aim to classify customers who are likely to leave based on their features, helping in proactive retention strategies.

Project Overview

The Churn Modelling project applies an ANN to classify customers as churn or non-churn based on their data. The model is built in Python, and the project includes data preprocessing, ANN construction, training, and evaluation.
Project Steps
Importing Libraries

We start by importing necessary libraries for data handling, preprocessing, and building neural networks.
Data Preprocessing

    Importing Dataset: Load customer data.
    Encoding Categorical Data: Transform categorical features into numerical representations.
    Splitting the Dataset: Separate the dataset into training and test sets.
    Feature Scaling: Normalize feature values for optimized ANN performance.

Building the ANN

    Initializing ANN: Define the structure of the neural network.
    Adding Input and Hidden Layers: Construct the input layer and two hidden layers.
    Adding Output Layer: Define the output layer for binary classification.

Training the ANN Model

    Compiling the ANN: Configure the learning process by specifying loss function and optimizer.
    Training the Model on the Training Set: Fit the model to the training data.

Making Predictions and Evaluating the Model

    Predicting a Single Observation: Test the model on an individual data instance.
    Predicting the Test Set Results: Run predictions on the test set to assess performance.
    Confusion Matrix and Accuracy Score: Evaluate model accuracy and performance with metrics.
